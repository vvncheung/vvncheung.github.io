# about me

Hi there, itâ€™s so nice to meet you! My name is Vivian Cheung and I am a software developer based in Toronto, Canada. In my past lives, I worked in documentary production at Riot Games and in talent marketing at Axiom Zen. As a storyteller, I've previously held roles in video production, marketing, and communications. 

I am passionate about video games (currently playing Risk of Rain 2, Gris, and Spiritfarer), tending to my indoor jungle of houseplants, and eating copious amounts of ice cream.
