# about me

Hi there, itâ€™s so nice to meet you! I'm Vivian Cheung, a software developer currently working with Unity and C# that's based in Toronto, Canada. In my past lives, I worked in documentary production at Riot Games and in talent marketing at Axiom Zen. As a storyteller, I've held roles in video production, marketing, and communications. 

I am passionate about video games (currently playing Overwatch 2, Valheim, and t-spinning in Tetris), tending to my indoor jungle of houseplants, and eating copious amounts of ice cream.
